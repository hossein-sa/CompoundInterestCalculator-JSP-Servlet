# CompoundInterestCalculator-JSP-Servlet
This is a simple web application that calculates compound interest based on the user's input of principal, annual interest rate, and number of years. The application was built using JSP, Servlet, and Tomcat, and styled with Bootstrap 5.

Getting Started
To run the application, you will need to have Tomcat installed on your machine. Once Tomcat is installed, you can deploy the application by copying the "compound-interest-calculator.war" file to the "webapps" directory in your Tomcat installation. Then, start Tomcat and navigate to "http://localhost:8080/compound-interest-calculator/" in your web browser to access the application.

How to Use
Enter the principal amount in the "Principal" field.
Enter the annual interest rate in the "Annual Interest Rate" field.
Enter the number of years in the "Number of Years" field.
Click the "Calculate" button to calculate the compound interest.
The result will be displayed on a new page, along with a button to calculate again.
